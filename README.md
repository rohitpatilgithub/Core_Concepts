# Hi, Myself Flux (aka Rohit) ! 🙏

## 🚀 About Me

🌕 *Note* : I know this repository doesn't contain complete core Java concepts so please do not whine about it 😊

🌗 I'm a student who is a Java enthusiast who is trying to learn in public

🌗 This repository was supposed to be a progress track but later I realised that I can share the knowledge with others too.. 

🌗 So I sorted my repository in such a way that it would be easy for any student to learn without any trouble
