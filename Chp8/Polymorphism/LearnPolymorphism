Polymorphism : Refers to the ability of objects of different types
               to be treated as if they were of the same type

               Real life Example : Water ( solid , liquid , gas )

     Types of Polymorphism :
        1. Compiler time polymorphism / static polymorphism
          ( we can achieve by method overloading)
        2. Run time polymorphism / dynamic polymorphism
          ( we can achieve by method overriding )

     For method overloading / Compiler time polymorphism we need 3 things
     1. Methods should be in same class
     2. Same method name 2 or more
     3. Different argument : a. type of arg
                             b. no of args
                             c. sequence of args

     For method overriding we need 3 things
     1. Methods should be in different class
     2. Same method name 2 or more
     3. Same argument :      a. type of arg
                             b. no of args
                             c. sequence of args
     4. Inheritance ( IS-A relationship )
