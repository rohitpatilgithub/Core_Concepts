String
1. Storage : Heap , SCP
2. Objects	: Immutable
3. Memory : If we change values multiple times , it will consume more storage
4. Thread-safe : Not thread safe
5. Performance : Slow
6. Use	: If there is less changes made to data

StringBuffer
1. Storage : Heap
2. Objects : Mutable
3. Memory : Less memory is consumed
4. Thread-safe : The methods are synchronized thus it is thread safe
5. Performance : Fast compared to String
6. Use : If frequency of changing data is high

StringBuilder
1. Storage : Heap
2. Objects : Mutable
3. Memory : Less memory is consumed
4. Thread-safe : Non synchronized methods so not thread safe
5. Performance : Fast compared to StringBuffer
6. Use : If frequency of changing data is high
